* This is **a project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
    * as a digital internship tracking tool for students
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _BizBook_) used for managing internship applications.
    * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
    * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `BizBook` (`BB` for short) because it helps organise all the businesses people are interested in doing internships for.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[BizBook Product Website](https://ay2526s1-cs2103t-t10-1.github.io/tp/)**.
- This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
